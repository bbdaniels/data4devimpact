  * Drop lines that only work after 8 PM - not rides data is collected outside of rush hour
  drop if inlist(substr(linha,1,4),"SCZP","JRIP")

  * Drop circular honorio - not present in rides data
  drop if substr(linha,1,3) == "HON"

  * Adjust var formats - some missing observations are marked as "-",
  * which causes Stata to read the variable as a string, not a number
  foreach varAux of varlist boardings exits seatprob {
    replace `varAux' = subinstr(`varAux',"-","",.)  // remove dash character
    replace `varAux' = strtrim(`varAux')            // remove spaces
    destring (`varAux'), replace                    // now it can be converted into a number
  }

  * Drop null station/line combinations
  drop if exits == . & boardings == .
